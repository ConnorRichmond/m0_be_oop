# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    It was fun! Learning the new things on my own and adding them to what I was taught if really gratifying.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    There definitely was a block for a while, but once I remembered to take a break and come back everything went so much better.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    '''ruby
    101.times do
    hobbit2.celebrate_birthday
    end
    '''
Is great for running a method on a var so I don't have to manually call it over and over again
I also need to remember the difference for when an attribute is something by default and when an attribute is default but could be dynamic if info is passed in initially
